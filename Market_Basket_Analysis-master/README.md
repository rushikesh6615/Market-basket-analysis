### Market_Basket_Analysis
This is the code for a __Market Basket Analysis__ project I have carried out. 
I have split the output into __three parts__ that I have organised as follows:

1. In the [__first__](https://diegousai.io/2019/03/market-basket-analysis-part-1-of-3) chapter, I source, explore and format a complex dataset suitable for modelling with recommendation algorithms.
 The __DATA__ can be found here: [__Online Retail__](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
 
2. For the [__second__](https://diegousai.io/2019/03/market-basket-analysis-part-2-of-3) part, I will apply various machine learning algorithms for Product Recommendation and select the best performing model. This will be done with the support of the __recommenderlab__ package.
 For Recommenderlab Package see:  [https://cran.r-project.org/package=recommenderlab](https://cran.r-project.org/package=recommenderlab)
 
3. In the [__third__](https://diegousai.io/2019/04/market-basket-analysis-part-3-of-3) and final instalment, I will implement the selected model in a Shiny Web Application.
